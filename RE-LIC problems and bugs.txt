back-end:
- while draging progressbar, the progressbar stops the line generating loop, after the release of dragging, the loop continues
- when the programm automatically closes and opens up then it should show users input again
- the invisible text should show again when user clicks somewhere else

front-end(design):
- the warning and pop-ups should be opened in location where the software is opened, in the center of the location of the software
- after user clicks somewhere else from the input, then should show again the message
- (maybe creating it): minimum resize for the software
- entrys should scale on resize same as other widgets
-(maybe creating it): all popup backgrounds same color as software background
