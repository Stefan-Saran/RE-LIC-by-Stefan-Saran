# RE-LIC-by-Stefan-Saran

This is my first ever project, i created it since i started learning about python.
It is a Tkinter qui Application made with python. What this project does is not very interesting.
You put a text in the box and you can choose how many lines of that text should be created in a text file.
But you can also use special characters to generate a random number, and letter on new lines.

I wanted to make this project because, i thought it would be a very cool idea. This project is for everyone who wants to generate
new lines of random text for some reason.

There are no special modules that uses this qui, so you just need python to run this.

The way this project works is very simple, it uses your text and the number of how many lines you want and checks for special characters you used, if there are any then it replaces it with 
new letter or number, it depends which special characters you used, for that you need to click the button "Help". After the lines are generated then it writes the lines in a text file.
the text file name will be named after the curent date and time.

Feel free to download.
